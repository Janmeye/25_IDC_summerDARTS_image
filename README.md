## Description
The purpose of this repository is for training purposes apart of UCF Data-Enabled Research Training and Development Sprint of summer 2025. This repository contains csv data files collected from testing of interdigitated Comb sensors for failure analysis. Students will use this dataset with python-based analysis techniques to explore the relationships between performance, degradation, and experimental conditions.
